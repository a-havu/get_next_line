get_next_line is a pretty straightforward project:
write a function that takes a file descriptor as a parameter, read from that file descriptor, and return the contents of the file descriptor line by line.
In this project, we learn about static variables, which are very handy indeed.
Bonus points for using only one static variable! ;)
